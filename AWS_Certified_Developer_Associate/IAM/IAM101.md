# Identity Access Management 101
- Identity Access Management (IAM) consists of users, groups, and roles.
- IAM is global and applies universally, not tied to specific regions.
- The root account is the initial AWS account created during setup, and it has full admin access.
- Avoid using the root account for day-to-day activities; instead, create IAM users with specific permissions.
- New IAM users have no permissions initially and must be explicitly granted the necessary permissions.
- IAM users are assigned an access key ID and secret access key for API and CLI access.
- Access keys should be saved securely since the secret access key is shown only once during creation.
- Enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for increased security on the root account.
- Custom password rotation policies can be set up for IAM users.
- IAM enables fine-grained control over AWS resources and permissions.
- IAM plays a crucial role in ensuring secure and controlled access to AWS services.
