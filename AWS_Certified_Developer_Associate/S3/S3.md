## Key Points - S3 Summary

### Object-Based Storage
- S3 is object-based storage for files like images, videos, code, etc.
- File size can be up to 5 terabytes, and S3 provides unlimited storage.
- S3 uses buckets, and bucket names must be unique in the universal namespace.

### S3 URL and Object Structure
- S3 URL: `bucketname.region.amazonaws.com/keyname`
- S3 objects have a key (object name), value (data), version ID, and metadata.

### S3 Storage Classes (Tiers)
- S3 Standard: Frequently accessed data.
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access: Long-term storage for infrequently accessed critical data.
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access: Long-term storage for noncritical infrequently accessed data.
- Glacier: Archiving long-lived data (Instant Retrieval for millisecond access, Deep Archive for rarely accessed data).
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between classes based on access patterns.

### S3 Security and Encryption
- S3 buckets are private by default.
- Bucket policies control access to buckets.
- Access logs can be enabled to log requests to a separate bucket.
- Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C) options available.
- Client-side encryption allows encrypting files before uploading to S3.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- CORS enables access to resources in one S3 bucket from another.
- Configured through CORS rules in S3 bucket settings.

### CloudFront and S3 Transfer Acceleration
- CloudFront: Caching service to improve website performance.
- Edge locations cache content and are separate from AWS Regions.
- CloudFront distribution represents the origin and configuration settings.
- S3 Transfer Acceleration uses CloudFront edge locations to reduce latency for uploads.

### CloudFront AllowedMethods
- AllowedMethods: Defines HTTP methods allowed by the CloudFront distribution.
- GET, HEAD: Read-only access.
- GET, HEAD, OPTIONS: Read-only access.
- PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE: Write access.

### AWS Certificate Manager and Athena
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Creates and manages SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections (HTTPS).
- ACM certificates for CloudFront must be created in the US-East-1 region.
- Athena: Interactive query service for querying data stored in S3 using standard SQL.
