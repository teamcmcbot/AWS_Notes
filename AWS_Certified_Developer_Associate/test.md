# Sample Markdown File

Welcome to my Markdown file! This is a simple example to demonstrate various Markdown features.

## Formatting Text

You can make text **bold** by enclosing it in double asterisks or underscores.

Italic text can be created using single asterisks or underscores.

You can also create ~~strikethrough~~ text by using double tildes.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can create [hyperlinks](https://www.example.com) by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

To embed images, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses for the image URL:
![Image alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)

## Code Blocks

You can denote inline code by using backticks, like `inline code`.

To create a code block, use triple backticks:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
